# Partial Discharge - Localisation (PD-Loc) Dataset-
Partial Discharge - Localization (PD-Loc) Dataset is a specialized dataset focused on the localization and pattern recognition of partial discharges (PD) in cable insulation defects. 
1. ​​Phase-Resolved Partial Discharge (PRPD) Analysis​​
PRPD analysis is a ​​traditional and widely used method​​ that plots PD pulses against the phase angle of the AC voltage cycle. It helps in visualizing discharge patterns and identifying insulation defects based on patterns like internal discharges, surface discharges, or corona discharges.
•​​How it works​​: PD pulses are recorded over multiple AC cycles, and their phase and amplitude are plotted in a 2D graph.
•Applications​​: Commonly used for switchgears, transformers, and cables.
•Limitations​​:
•Sensitive to ​​noise and harmonic distortions​​ in the power supply.
•Requires expert interpretation for accurate diagnosis.
•Struggles with ​​phase-shifted data​​ common in field measurements.
2. ​​Pulse Sequence Analysis (PSA)​​
PSA focuses on the ​​sequence and relationship between consecutive PD pulses​​ rather than their phase distribution. It provides insights into the local electric field dynamics within insulation defects.
•​​How it works​​: Parameters like time between pulses, charge amplitude, or voltage are analyzed recursively to identify patterns.
•​​Applications​​: Useful for analyzing electrical treeing in solid insulation like epoxy resin.
•Limitations​​:
•Highly sensitive to measurement noise.
•Requires high-resolution data acquisition
